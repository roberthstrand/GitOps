# GitOps
Source Repository for 'GitOps from infrastructure to application, with GitHub', by @roberthstrand. The idea is to show how one can set up a healthy GitOps workflow, from a mono-repository. This is just an example, there is _no one true way_ of doing this. However, for most small to medium scale deployments, I'm fairly certain that this way of controlling your cloud platform is adequate.
